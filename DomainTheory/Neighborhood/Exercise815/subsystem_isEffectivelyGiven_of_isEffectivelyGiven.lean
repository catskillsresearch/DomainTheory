/-- **Exercise 8.15, first half.** If `D` is effectively given, there is an effectively given
neighbourhood system (`SubD P`, on tokens `List ℕ`) whose elements are order-isomorphic to
`{D' ∣ D' ◁ D}` — a *direct*, choice-free construction (Subgoals 1–4), unlike the classical route
through `Exercise222.reprIso` (`Proposition611.subsystemReprIso`). -/
