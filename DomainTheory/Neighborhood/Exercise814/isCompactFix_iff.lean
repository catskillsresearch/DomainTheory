/-- **Exercise 8.14, the final question, answered exactly.** `y ∈ Fix(a)` is compact (i.e. is a
*finite element* of the fixed-point domain) **iff** `y = a(↑X)` for a single `E`-neighbourhood `X`.
The forward direction is a sandwich argument: `y` is the directed union of the compacts `a(↑X)`
(`X ∈ y`, `toElementMap_eq_iSupDirected_genFamily`), so compactness pulls out a single witness `X`
with `y ⊑ a(↑X)`; the reverse inequality `a(↑X) ⊑ y` is automatic since `X ∈ y`. -/
