Scott continuity of a map between complete lattices is equivalent to preservation of directed suprema. This is Scott's Proposition 2.5.

One direction is the theorem that a Scott-continuous map preserves directed suprema. The other is the theorem that preservation of directed suprema yields Scott continuity.
