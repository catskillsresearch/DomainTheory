/-- In a continuous lattice the sets `↟a = {z | a ≪ z}` form a basis of the Scott topology:
every Scott-open `U` containing `z` contains some basic neighbourhood `↟a` of `z`. Indeed
`z = ⊔{a | a ≪ z}` is a directed supremum lying in the open set `U`, so some `a ≪ z` already
lies in `U`, and then `↟a ⊆ ↑a ⊆ U`. -/
