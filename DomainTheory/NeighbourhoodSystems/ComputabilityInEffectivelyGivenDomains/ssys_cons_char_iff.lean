The consistency decision on two indices is true if and only if some neighbourhood of the system is contained in the intersection of the neighbourhoods at those indices.

Rewrite by the equivalence of the decision with consistency of the two safe active decodes, and by the equivalence of that consistency with the existence of such a neighbourhood.
