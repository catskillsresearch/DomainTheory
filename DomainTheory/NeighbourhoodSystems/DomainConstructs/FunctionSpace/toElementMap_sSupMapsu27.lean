Theorem 3.13(iii) of Scott (1981, PRG-19) states that when a family of approximable maps is bounded in the sense of MapsBounded, the value of its supremum at an element x equals the supremum of the values of its members at x.

The boundedness hypothesis is rewritten as pointwise boundedness, and the identity is the corresponding identity for pointwise bounded families.
