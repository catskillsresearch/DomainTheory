/-ai
If each term of a sequence lies below the corresponding term of another sequence, then the iterate element of the first sequence lies below the iterate element of the second.

A neighbourhood of the first element is an iterate neighbourhood whose fibers lie in the first sequence, and the termwise inequality places those fibers in the second sequence.
