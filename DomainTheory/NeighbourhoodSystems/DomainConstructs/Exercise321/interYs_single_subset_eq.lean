For a single step whose output is a neighbourhood, if the input is contained in the step input, the intersection of the relevant outputs is that output.

A token of the intersection lies in the output of every listed step whose input contains the given input, and the single step is such a step. Conversely, a token of the output lies in the master, and it is the output required of the only step on the list.
