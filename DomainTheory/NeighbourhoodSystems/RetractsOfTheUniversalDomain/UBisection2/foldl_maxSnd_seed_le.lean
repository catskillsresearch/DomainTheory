/-ai
A seed is at most the left fold of the maximum of second components.

Induct on the list, generalizing the seed. The empty fold is the seed. For a cons cell, the seed is at most the maximum with the head's second component, and that maximum is at most the remaining fold by the inductive hypothesis.
