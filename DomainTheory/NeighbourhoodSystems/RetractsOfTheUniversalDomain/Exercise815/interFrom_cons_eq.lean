The intersection along a list with head j and tail sub is the basic neighbourhood named by j, intersected with the intersection along the tail.

Extensionality reduces the claim to membership. The membership characterization of the intersection, together with the splitting of a universal quantifier over a cons cell, makes the two sides the same proposition.
