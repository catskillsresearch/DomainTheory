/-ai
If a stem neighbourhood Y is a proper subset of a stem neighbourhood X, then the principal filter of X is strictly below the principal filter of Y.

The inequality of principal filters is the subset relation. The two filters are distinct because principal filters are injective and X differs from Y.
