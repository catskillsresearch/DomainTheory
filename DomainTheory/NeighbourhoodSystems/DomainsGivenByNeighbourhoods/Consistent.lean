/-- A finite sequence `X₀, …, Xₙ₋₁` of neighbourhoods is *consistent in* `𝒟` when it has a
common lower bound inside `𝒟`: some `Z ∈ 𝒟` contained in the intersection `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ`
(equivalently, contained in every `Xⱼ`, `j < n`). This is Scott's notion of consistency,
generalized from pairs to finite sequences. -/
