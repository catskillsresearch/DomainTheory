/-ai
One finite element of the binary system approximates another if and only if the first string is an initial segment of the second.

Unfold the finite elements, rewrite the order of principal filters as inclusion of cones, and rewrite that inclusion as the prefix relation.

/-- **Factoid (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** "`σ₀⊥ ⊆ σ₁⊥` if and only if `σ₀` is an *initial segment* of
the sequence `σ₁`." The approximation order on finite elements is exactly the prefix order:
`σ₀⊥ ⊑ σ₁⊥ ↔ σ₀ <+: σ₁`. (Via `principal_le_iff` — reversal — composed with `cone_subset_cone` —
reversal again — which cancel to give the prefix order directly.) -/

    sigmaBot σ₀ ≤ sigmaBot σ₁ ↔ σ₀ <+: σ₁ := by
