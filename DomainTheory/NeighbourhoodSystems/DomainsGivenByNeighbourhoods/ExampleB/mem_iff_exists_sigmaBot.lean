/-- **Factoid (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** "`x = ⋃ₙ σₙ⊥`": every `x ∈ |B|` is the union of the finite
elements `σ⊥` whose generating cone `σΣ*` lies in `x`. In membership form, a neighbourhood `Z`
belongs to `x` iff `Z` lies in some `σ⊥ = ↑(σΣ*)` with `σΣ* ∈ x`.

This is the concrete "an element is uniquely determined by its finite approximations" in `|B|`
(`Basic.eq_iUnion_principal` specialized to `B`, where every neighbourhood is a cone). The further
arrangement of the `σ` into a single increasing chain `σ₀ ⪯ σ₁ ⪯ …` requires choice/enumeration and
is left to Scott's prose. -/
