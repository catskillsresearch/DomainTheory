Scott's Example 1.B is the binary neighbourhood system whose neighbourhoods are the cones of finite binary strings. It is obtained from the nested-or-disjoint construction, with master neighbourhood the set of all strings, witnessed as nonempty by the empty string and identified with the cone of the empty string, using that any two cones are nested or disjoint and that every set of strings is contained in the set of all strings.
