/-ai
Two neighbourhood systems, possibly over different token types, determine isomorphic domains when there is an order isomorphism between their elements. This is Scott's Definition 1.9.

/-- **Definition 1.9 (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** Two neighbourhood systems `𝒟₀` and `𝒟₁` (over possibly
*different* token types) *determine isomorphic domains* iff there is a one-one, inclusion-preserving
correspondence between `|𝒟₀|` and `|𝒟₁|`. We package "one-one + preserves inclusion (both ways)" as
mathlib's order-isomorphism `≃o`: an `OrderIso` is automatically a bijection that *reflects* as well
as preserves `⊑` (`map_rel_iff`), which is exactly Scott's requirement. -/
