Pointwise multiplication distributes on the right over union: the product of a ∪ b with c equals the union of the products of a with c and of b with c.

Extensionality reduces the claim to membership. A product witness whose first factor lies in the union splits into one of the two summands, and a witness from either summand returns to the union.
