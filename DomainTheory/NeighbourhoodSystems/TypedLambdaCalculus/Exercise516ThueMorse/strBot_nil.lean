The partial element of the empty string is the bottom element of C, since the cone of the empty string is the master neighbourhood.

By extensionality of elements, membership in the empty partial element rewrites, through principal membership, the empty cone, and the master of C, as membership in bottom. A neighbourhood contained in the master equals the master, and the master is a neighbourhood contained in itself.
