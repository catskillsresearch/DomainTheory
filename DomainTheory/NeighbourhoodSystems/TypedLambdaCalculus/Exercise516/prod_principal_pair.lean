The principal element of the product neighbourhood of the shapes of (b₀, σ) and (b₁, τ) is the pair of those two shape elements.

By extensionality of elements, compare membership of a neighbourhood. Membership in the principal element is a product neighbourhood contained in the given product neighbourhood, which splits into a containment in each factor, and that is membership in the pair. The converse reassembles the two containments into one product containment.
