If an injection and a projection between images under T are heterogeneously equal to the canonical injection and projection of a subdomain, then after the carriers are identified with the token type their composite is heterogeneously equal to the injection-projection composite of the transported subdomain.

Substitution of the two carrier equalities and of the two system equalities turns the heterogeneous equalities into ordinary equalities, and rewriting by them leaves the two composites the same.

/-- **The carrier-transport core of `T(ρₙ) = ρₙ₊₁`.** Given the *monotone-on-domains* data for a
subsystem (its injection `Tmi`/projection `Tmj` are heterogeneously equal to the canonical 6.12 pair
`sub.inj`/`sub.proj` of the image subsystem `sub : Ps ◁ ce ▸ Qs`), the composite `Tmi ∘ Tmj` is —
after carrying the functor-image carriers `Pc, Qc` down to `Tok` — exactly the projection
`iₙ₊₁ ∘ jₙ₊₁` of the next subsystem `hsub' : Dn1 ◁ Col`. Proved by `subst`ing the carrier equalities,
after which proof-irrelevance identifies the two subsystem proofs. -/
