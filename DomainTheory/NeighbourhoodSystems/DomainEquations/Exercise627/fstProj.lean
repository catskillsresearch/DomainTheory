The projection from the product of D₀ and D₁ back to D₀ relates W to X when W is a product neighbourhood, X is a neighbourhood of D₀, and W is contained in the product of X with the master of D₁. Domain and codomain membership are the corresponding conjuncts, and the masters are related by a reflexive inclusion. For an intersection on the right, the product form of W has first factor contained in both target neighbourhoods, hence in their intersection, while the second factor lies below the master of D₁. If W' lies below W and X lies below X', the inclusions compose with the product inclusion induced by that containment of first factors.
