If a functor is continuous on maps and D is isomorphic to its image, then every algebra whose structure map is strict receives a strict homomorphism from D, namely the least fixed point of the operator sending h to the structure map composed with the functor applied to h, composed with the inverse isomorphism.

The inverse isomorphism is strict because its composite with the structure map is the identity. Continuity supplies an approximable witness, and the operator is post- and pre-composition with the structure map and the inverse, composed with that witness. The witness sends the filter of the least fixed point's strict map h to the filter of the functor applied to h, so the action lemma says the operator sends the fixed point to the filter of the composite k composed with that image composed with the inverse. The fixed-point equation and injectivity of the strict representation on filters give the equation for h. Precomposing with the structure map and cancelling the inverse composite, which is the identity, yields the homomorphism square. The homomorphism is strict because h is.

/-- **Theorem 6.9 (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** If `T` is continuous on maps and `D ≅ T(D)` (so `D` is a
`T`-algebra via `i : T(D) → D`), then for any `T`-algebra `B = (E, k)` with `k` strict there is a
homomorphism `D → E`. The homomorphism is the least fixed point of `λh. k ∘ T(h) ∘ j`. -/
