/-ai
An element equals the directed supremum of the principal elements of its neighbourhoods.

Elements that contain the same neighbourhoods are equal, and membership in the directed supremum is membership in some principal. A neighbourhood of the element belongs to its own principal. A neighbourhood of the principal of some neighbourhood of the element is a neighbourhood contained in that set, hence belongs to the element by upward closure.
