/-ai
A set belongs to the element obtained by prepending a string to the run map's value exactly when the set is a neighbourhood and some cone of the element has the cone of that string followed by the output of the cone contained in the set.

Membership in the shifted element gives a neighbourhood of the run-map value and an inclusion. The membership criterion supplies a cone whose output cone sits in that neighbourhood, and prepending the string preserves the inclusion. Conversely the output cone belongs to the run-map value, and prepending the string turns the concatenated inclusion into the shifted membership.

/-- **The "shift formula" for `runMap` (output side).** Since `g(x)`'s membership predicate is
itself a cone-monotone family (`runMap_toElementMap_mem`), prepending `τ₀` to `g(x)` collapses the
same way: the up-closure of neighbourhoods `Z ⊇ (out τ)Σ*` is absorbed because `(out τ)Σ*` itself
is the *deepest* (hence hardest-to-satisfy, so witness-minimal) choice. -/
