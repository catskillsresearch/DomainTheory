If every element of a finite set of natural numbers has its singleton complement in an element of the powerset domain, then the complement of that finite set belongs to the element.

The proof inducts on the finite set. The complement of the empty set is the universe, which is the master neighbourhood of the element. The complement of a set with one element inserted is the intersection of the corresponding singleton complement with the complement of the remaining set, and an element is closed under intersection.
